# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized, git adds some files which then can be used by git to store the meta data necessary for git's version control scheme.

Without initializing, git won't be able to store the necessary meta data for version control.


# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area can contain subset of files within a repository. 

The stating area doesn't really make sense unless the working directory is a repository.

Staging area can be used to break up a commit into individual files.
